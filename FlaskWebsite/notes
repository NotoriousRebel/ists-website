Hello.

Ok I have redone as much as the site as I can. It is using bootstrap, the CDN for bootstrap is in app/templates/base.html.

The layout of the code is as follows:

app/
    __init__.py
    views.py
    static/
    templates/
tmp/
config.py
run.py

* the app/static/ directory is where images are. I didn't realize you had it set up so images were under /images/ until after I had set it up and I'm lazy :p.
* the app/templates/ directory is where html files are. There is one special html file called "base.html". This file contains the nav-bar and the bootstrap CDN
links, and the general wrapping html tags. You 'import' this into every html file you make, so you don't have to rewrite code. An example of this is done in the
app/templates/about.html page. TLDR:

app/templates/newfile.html:
-------------
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
<h1> content goes between the blocks!<h1>
{% endblock $}


* in the config.py file, is ISTS_YEAR. This makes it easier to replace what year it is in all the files. To use this, in your app/views.py file you can do something like this:

app/views.py:
-------------
@app.route("/whatyearisit")
def yearDisplay():
    return render_template("mypage.html", ists_year=app.config['ISTS_YEAR'])

mypage.html:
------------
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
    <h1> The year is {{ists_year}}!</h1>
{% endblock %}
